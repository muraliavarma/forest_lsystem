# L-systems and Forests ðŸŒ³

A Three.js implementation of L-systems using Turtle Graphics to generate beautiful procedural forest scenes.

## Overview

This project implements Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) using Three.js and Turtle Graphics to create procedurally generated forest scenes. L-systems are a mathematical formalism used to model the growth processes of plant development and fractal patterns.

## Features

- Procedural generation of trees using L-systems
- Realistic 3D rendering using Three.js
- Interactive controls for customizing tree parameters
- Multiple tree species and growth patterns
- Beautiful forest scene generation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forest_lsystem.git
cd forest_lsystem
```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser or serve it using a local web server:
```bash
# Using Python's built-in server
python -m http.server

# Or using Node.js
npx serve
```

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Use the interactive controls to adjust tree parameters
3. Generate new forest scenes with different configurations
